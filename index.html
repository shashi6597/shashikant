        Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly
        massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks. They use their trunks to
        pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up
        water for drinking or bathing, among other uses. Both male and female
        African elephants grow tusks and each individual can either be left- or
        right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of
        wear and tear. Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth
        can be used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects,
        gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can also be used for
        defense. During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig
        holes to find water underground. Two genetically different African
        species exist: the savanna elephant and the forest elephant, with a
        number of characteristics that differentiate them both. The African
        savanna elephant is the largest elephant species, while the Asian forest
        elephant and the African forest elephant are of a comparable, smaller
        size. Asian elephants differ in several ways from their African
        relatives, with more than 10 distinct physical differences between them.
        For example, Asian elephants' ears are smaller compared to the large
        fan-shaped ears of the African species. Only some male Asian elephants
        have tusks, while both male and female African elephants grow tusks. Led
        by a matriarch, elephants are organized into complex social structures
        of females and calves, while male elephants tend to live in isolation or
        in small bachelor groups. A single calf is born to a female once every
        four to five years and after a gestation period of 22 monthsâ€”the longest
        of any mammal. Calves are cared for by the entire herd of related
        females. Female calves may stay with their maternal herd for the rest of
        their lives, while males leave the herd as they reach puberty. Forest
        elephants' social groups differ slightly and may be comprised of only an
        adult female and her offspring. However, they may congregate in larger
        groups in forest clearings where resources are more abundant. Elephants
        need extensive land areas to survive and meet their ecological needs,
        which includes food, water, and space. On average, an elephant can feed
        up to 18 hours and consume hundreds of pounds of plant matter in a
        single day. As a result, as they lose habitat, they often come into
        conflict with people in competition for resources.

            <p>
              Elephants help maintain forest and savanna ecosystems for other
              species and are integrally tied to rich biodiversity. Elephants
              are important ecosystem engineers. They make pathways in dense
              forested habitat that allow passage for other animals. An elephant
              footprint can also enable a micro-ecosystem that, when filled with
              water, can provide a home for tadpoles and other organisms. As
              keystone species, they help maintain biodiversity of the
              ecosystems they inhabit.

            <h4>ASIAN ELEPHANT (ELEPHAS MAXIMUS BENGALENSIS)</h4>
            <p>
              Elephants play a pivotal role in shaping their habitat and
              directly influence forest composition and density, disperse seeds,
              and alter the broader landscape. In tropical forests, elephants
              create clearings and gaps in the canopy that encourage tree
              regeneration. In the savannas, they reduce bush cover to create an
              environment favorable to a mix of browsing and grazing animals.

            <p>
              The seeds of many plant species in central African and Asian
              forests are dependent on passing through an elephant's digestive
              tract before they can germinate. It is calculated that at least a
              third of tree species in central African forests rely on elephants
              in this way for distribution of seeds.
